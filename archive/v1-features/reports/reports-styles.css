   REPORTS FEATURE - CSS STYLES
   Archived from app.html
   ================================

   NOTE: The Reports feature primarily uses inline styles and general-purpose CSS classes
   from the main application stylesheet. No specific dedicated CSS was found for this feature.

   The feature relies on existing classes such as:
   - .tab-content
   - .content-header
   - .card
   - .btn
   - .input
   - .report-preview
   - .report-header
   - .report-section
   - .stats-grid
   - .stat-card
   - .stat-number
   - .report-table
   - .status-badge
   - .loading
   - .error

   These are all defined in the main application styles and are shared across multiple features.
